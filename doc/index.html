<h1>Adder: Python with a Lisp</h1>

<h2>By <a href="/">John Stracke</a></h2>

<p>Adder : <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> ::

<p>Adder is a Lisp-1 which compiles to Python.  It aims to
integrate seamlessly into Python: every Adder function is a Python
function, every Adder list is a Python list, etc.
</p>

<p>Python-on-Lisp has been tried before; I think Adder has two advantages
that previous attempts did not.  The first is technical: Python's
metaprogramming has gotten better in the past few years, which allows
Adder to integrate more smoothly.  The second is social: Clojure has
prepared the ground for the notion of a Lisp that integrates into an
existing language.
</p>

<p>It has one bit of non-Lispy syntax: <code>foo.bar.baz</code>
means exactly what
it does in Python, and <code>.bar.baz</code> is a function,
defined so that

<code>(.bar.baz foo)</code> is identical to <code>foo.bar.baz</code>.

<p>Adder is now released; you can get the code from
<a href="http://github.com/metageek/adder">Github</a>.  Documentation:

<p><a href="presentation.pdf">The slides from the lightning
talk I gave at ILC09.</a>  Note that these are now dated; I had to
  start from scratch, compiling to Python instead of directly to Python
  bytecode (because bytecode is not stable from one version of Python
  to the next).
