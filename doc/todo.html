<h1>Adder: To-Do List</h1>

<dl>

<dt>Compiler performance is poor.</dt>
<dd>This has been ameliorated by caching the generated Python code for
  modules, the way CPython caches .pyc files.
</dd>

<dt>When an exception is thrown while compiling a module, delete the
  cache file.
</dt>

<dt>Regression tests to test the things that are too hard to test in
  unit tests.
</dt>

<dt>TCO</dt>
<dd>See <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2133379">thread
    at Hacker News</a>.
</dd>

<dt>Logic programming</dt>
<dd>It would be very cool to give Adder a logic
  programming system.  Initially a simple one, as described in the
  early chapters of <i>The Art of Prolog,</i> but it'd be nice to
  extend it to use a SQL backend.  The system should include the
  ability to trigger arbitrary Adder code.
</dd>

<dt>Return and yield in helper functions. Probably solved.</dt>
<dd>There are a few places where we use a helper function to solve the
  statement problem.  E.g., <code>(:=)</code> and
  <code>(if)</code>.  We need to worry about return
  and yield&mdash;can't translate them directly, or we'll be returning
  from the helper.
Currently working on this; tackling it by replacing with (return-from)
  and (yield-from).  Problem: these work fine for (defun); for
  (lambda), there's no name.  Add a :block arg to (lambda).  Also to
  (begin).
</dd>
<dt>Refactor <code>adder.pyle.build</code> and
  <code>adder.util.build</code></dt>
<dd>Too many special cases; need to move that knowledge into the
  function classes.  Ideally, this would make it easier for the
  function classes to do rewriting&mdash;it's absurd that they have to
  call each other instead of calling <code>build</code> with the lists
  they want.
</dd>
<dt>Make <code>(-gomer-try)</code> work as an expr.</dt>
<dd>Depends on solving the statement problem, above.  Probably solved.
</dd>
<dt>Error reporting</dt>
<dd>Lots and lots of places where constraints are asserted.  Should
  all be replaced with proper error reporting.
</dd>
