integrate seamlessly into Python: every Adder function is a Python
function, every Adder list is a Python list, etc.

   (h.<p> "Python-on-Lisp has been tried before; I think Adder has two advantages
that previous attempts did not.  The first is technical: Python's
metaprogramming has gotten better in the past few years, which allows
Adder to integrate more smoothly.  The second is social: Clojure has
prepared the ground for the notion of a Lisp that integrates into an
existing language.

" (h.<em> "Running") " the code once it's generated is plenty fast, but
startup times are excessive."
